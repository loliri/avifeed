# avifeed

📖 README: **English** | **[简体中文](README.zh.md)**

**avifeed** is a Node.js HTTP server that watches a directory of images, automatically re-encodes them to [AVIF](https://aomediacodec.github.io/av1-avif/), and serves a random one on every request.

---

## Why AVIF?

AVIF (AV1 Image File Format) is the most efficient widely-supported image format today:

- **30–50 % smaller** than JPEG at equivalent visual quality
- **Better than WebP** on complex gradients and fine detail
- **HDR and wide-gamut** support built in
- Supported natively in Chrome, Firefox, Safari 16+, and all modern mobile browsers

Serving AVIF means less bandwidth, faster page loads, and lower storage costs — with no visible quality loss.

---

## Features

- Drop images into a folder → they are encoded to AVIF automatically
- Content-addressed output filenames (`name.<sha256prefix>.avif`) — safe to cache forever
- `GET /` returns a random image on every call
- `GET /?redirect=1` issues a 302 to the stable content URL so browsers can cache it
- ETag + `Cache-Control: immutable` on `/images/:filename`
- File watcher (chokidar) picks up additions, changes, and deletions in real time
- Manifest persisted to disk atomically — survives restarts without re-encoding
- `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/metrics` endpoints out of the box
- Graceful shutdown: drains the encode queue before exiting
- Configurable via `config.json` and `RIS_*` environment variables

---

## Requirements

- Node.js ≥ 20
- `npm install` (sharp bundles its own libvips — no system dependency needed on most platforms)

---

## Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<you>/avifeed.git
cd avifeed
npm install
cp config.example.json config.json   # edit as needed
npm run build
npm start
```

Drop images into `./images/source/`. Visit `http://localhost:2333/` to get a random one.

## HTTP API

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/` | Returns a random AVIF image (`Cache-Control: no-store`) |
| `GET` | `/?redirect=1` | 302 redirect to the content-addressed URL |
| `GET` | `/images/:filename` | Serves a specific image; ETag + 1-year immutable cache |
| `GET` | `/healthz` | Liveness probe — always `{"status":"ok"}` |
| `GET` | `/readyz` | Readiness probe — checks the output dir is writable, returns manifest size |
| `GET` | `/metrics` | Plain-text metrics: manifest entries, optimizer queue length |

---

## Configuration

Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` and edit. Every field also has an `RIS_*` environment variable that takes precedence.

| Field | Env var | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `port` | `RIS_PORT` | `2333` | HTTP port |
| `sourceDir` | `RIS_SOURCE_DIR` | `./images/source` | Source images directory |
| `optimizedDir` | `RIS_OPTIMIZED_DIR` | `./images/optimized` | AVIF output directory |
| `manifestPath` | `RIS_MANIFEST_PATH` | `./images/manifest.json` | Manifest file path |
| `avifQuality` | `RIS_AVIF_QUALITY` | `50` | AVIF quality 1–100 |
| `avifEffort` | `RIS_AVIF_EFFORT` | `4` | AVIF encode effort 0–9 (higher = smaller file, slower) |
| `watch` | `RIS_WATCH` | `true` | Watch source dir for changes |
| `scanOnStart` | `RIS_SCAN_ON_START` | `false` | Re-scan source dir on every startup |
| `asyncIo` | `RIS_ASYNC_IO` | `false` | Use `fs.promises` in the optimizer (sync by default to throttle disk pressure) |
| `stabilizeMs` | `RIS_STABILIZE_MS` | `200` | How long file size must stay constant before encoding starts |
| `stabilizePollMs` | `RIS_STABILIZE_POLL_MS` | `50` | Poll interval for stabilization check |
| `stabilizeTimeoutMs` | `RIS_STABILIZE_TIMEOUT_MS` | `10000` | Max wait for stabilization |
| _(env only)_ | `RIS_HASH_LENGTH` | `8` | Hex chars of SHA-256 to embed in filename |
| _(env only)_ | `RIS_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | pino log level |
| _(env only)_ | `RIS_CONFIG` | `./config.json` | Path to config file |

## How it works

1. **Bootstrap** — loads the manifest, removes entries whose optimized file is gone, cleans up entries whose source was deleted. Optionally scans the full source directory.
2. **Watch** — chokidar monitors the source directory (non-recursive). Only recognised image extensions are processed; hidden files and temp files are ignored.
3. **Stabilize** — before encoding, the optimizer polls the file size until it stays constant for `stabilizeMs` ms, avoiding reads on half-written uploads.
4. **Encode** — sharp converts the source to AVIF and writes it atomically (temp file → rename). If the same source file changes again while encoding, the in-flight job is aborted and a new one is queued.
5. **Persist** — the manifest is written synchronously via tmp-file + rename after every change, so a crash leaves no inconsistency.

## Deployment

A hardened systemd unit is in [`deploy/randpicnode.service`](deploy/randpicnode.service). See [`deploy/README.md`](deploy/README.md) for installation steps.

Run behind a reverse proxy (nginx, caddy) for TLS and rate limiting.

## GitHub repository setup

Suggested fields when creating the repo:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Repository name** | `avifeed` |
| **Description** | A Node.js random image server that auto-encodes photos to AVIF and serves them over HTTP |
| **Topics / tags** | `nodejs` `avif` `image-server` `fastify` `sharp` `self-hosted` |
| **Website** | your deployment URL, e.g. `https://img.example.com` |
| **Social preview** | a sample AVIF output works well |

Recommended `.github/` additions:
- `ISSUE_TEMPLATE` — bug report + feature request
- `FUNDING.yml` — if you want sponsorship links
